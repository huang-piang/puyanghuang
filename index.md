## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Samueli Electrical and Computer Engineering Departement at University of California, Los Angeles, under the supervision of Prof. Kang L. Wang. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) and Master degree in Electronic Science and Technology from ShanghaiTech University. 

## Research Interests

My current research interest is spin-orbit torque (SOT) related physics as well as novel computing network applications based on MRAM. 
- **Spin Orbit Torque and Voltage Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy** 
- **Mganetic Random Access Memory** 
- **Neuromorphic Computing** 

## News
